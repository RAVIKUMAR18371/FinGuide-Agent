## 🚀 Proposed Solution

FinGuide AI uses IBM Watsonx's no-code platform to simulate an **Agentic AI** assistant that:
- Understands queries like "What is EMI?" or "How to avoid UPI fraud?"
- Uses **RAG** to fetch real, government-verified information
- Generates accurate and contextual responses using IBM’s **Granite Foundation Model**
- Interacts in **Hindi and English** for wider accessibility
- Empowers users to **protect themselves from fraud**, budget effectively, and manage personal finance confidently
